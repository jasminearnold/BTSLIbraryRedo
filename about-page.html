              BANGTAN SONYEONDAN aka BTS is a South Korean boy band formed in
              2010. The band consists of Jin, RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and
              Jungkook. The members, as they are known, are talented musicians
              and avid readers. The group became famous not only for their
              musical hits but also through the documentation of their journey
              from being idol trainees to k-pop performers. The group’s fans are
              called ARMY. BTS consistently shares their lives to ARMY through
              live streaming on the Weverse and Vlive App as well as posting

              not only shares the process of making music, but also their
              everyday lives such as rehearsals and downtime reading books.
